                <dt>Agra, India</dt>
                <dd>- Yes, Agra home to one of the last standing Seven Wonders of the World: The Taj Mahal. I had of course heard many stories and seen many photos but nothing compared to seeing the real thing with my own two eyes. Absolutely beautiful.</dd>
                <dt>El Yunque, Puerto Rico</dt>
                <dd>- My trip to Puerto Rico was quite unforgettable. One of the highlights of my trip was hiking through the massive tropical rainforest El Yunque. It took hours and all the while I was able to take in its amazing sights. When I finally reached the top, the view made all that effort worthwhile.</dd>
                <dt>Charlotte, USA</dt>
                <dd>- I was in Charlotte, NC for work all summer but I did make time to take in the sights of the city. Being from the Midwest I did not have much knowledge about the American South but I learned quite a bit. The food was absolutely amazing and I really felt that "southern hospitality" for the first time in my life.</dd>
